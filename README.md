Extracts 20+ acoustic features, including:

MFCCs (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients) – essential for speech recognition.

Spectral Contrast – helps distinguish different phonetic components.

Zero Crossing Rate (ZCR) – detects speech characteristics.

# 🤖 Machine Learning

Random Forest Regressor trained on a large speech dataset to predict grammar accuracy.

Provides real-time grammar scores (0.0 - 1.0 scale) to indicate spoken correctness.

# 📊 Visual Analytics

Waveform display for speech visualization.

MFCC heatmap for feature analysis.

Download full CSV report for detailed insights.
